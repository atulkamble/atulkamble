🚀 **Docker & Cloud-Native Community Contributions (Atul Kamble)**

I actively contribute to the Docker and cloud-native ecosystems via content creation, advocacy, mentorship, and real-world infrastructure projects.

**🔸 Content Creation & Advocacy:**

📺 Published a hands-on YouTube tutorial: *[Learn Docker Basics: Install, Run NGINX, and Build a Python App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_iv7dsqG-s)*, simplifying container concepts for developers.

📝 Authored a detailed Docker tutorial covering installation, container management, NGINX deployment, and Python app containerization.

🎯 Designed interactive, community-driven [Docker quiz](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/atuljkamble_docker-containers-devops-activity-7270280096710623232-EcTC) posts to promote hands-on DevOps learning.

👥 Served as a jury member and mentor at *MIT-WPU TechFest 2025*, reviewing Docker and cloud-native projects and providing architectural feedback.

**🔸 Real-World Implementation:**

As a Cloud Solutions Architect, I integrated Docker into AWS and Azure projects using registries, CI/CD pipelines, Docker Compose, Swarm, and Kubernetes — delivering scalable, secure containerized solutions with image optimization and automation.

**🔸 Mentorship & Workshops:**

Conducted Docker workshops covering image creation, multi-stage builds, security, and CI/CD integrations. Mentored early-career engineers on Docker and DevOps workflows.
